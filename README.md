# Harnessing Electric Fields for Sustainable Solar Panel Cleaning in the Sahara

## Overview

In the Sahara Desert, maintaining solar panel efficiency is challenging due to the accumulation of sand and dust. Traditional cleaning methods often rely on substantial water usage and complex logistics to transport water to remote areas. This project presents a novel computational modeling approach that utilizes electric fields to clean solar panels, aiming to reduce water consumption and improve the sustainability and efficiency of solar power generation in harsh desert conditions.

## Project Objectives

- **Minimize Water Usage**: Reduce the dependence on water for cleaning solar panels.
- **Optimize Cleaning Process**: Develop an efficient method to clean solar panels using electric fields.
- **Enhance Sustainability**: Improve the sustainability of solar power generation in the Sahara Desert by reducing logistical challenges associated with water transport.

## Computational Modeling

The project involves developing a computational model to simulate the effectiveness of using electric fields for cleaning solar panels. Key components of the model include:

- **Design of Electric Field Mechanism**: Dynamic simulation of a moving electric field and its impact on dust and sand accumulation.
- **Simulation Results**: Presentation of results demonstrating the potential benefits of the electric field approach.
